def gindex(arr):
    """
    Calculate g-index for an author.

    An g-index of x means that the author's top x publications
    together accumulated at least x^2 itations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : array-like
          Array of citations.

    Returns
    -------
    gi : int
         g-index of the author for the given citations.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from scholarmetrics import gindex
    >>> citations = [6, 10, 5, 46, 0, 2]
    >>> gindex(citations)
    6

    Notes
    -----
    The g-index was originally proposed by Leo Egghe [1]_.  It excludes
    uncited publications.

def hindex(arr):
    """
    Calculate h-index for an author.

    An h-index of x means that the author has at least x publications
